# Simple Calculator

## Part 1 

The interface should be created to match the user interface (UI) presented.

To build the UI, please follow the following tasks:
This  is  a  simple  calculator  for  basic  operations  (  +,-,x,  and  /)  for  two  inputs.  

Each button  will  perform  the  logic  of  the  corresponding  operation  and  display  the  result  in the Result textView.
Note that:a.Add operation: Result = Number1 + Number 2b.Subtract operation: Result = Number1 - Number 2c.Multiply operation: Result = Number1 * Number 2d.Divide operation: Result = Number1 / Number 2e.Clear All should clear all the input fields and resets the Result to 0.00

Your  code  should  check  for  special  cases  such  as  when  there  are  no  numbers entered,  invalid  numbers  and  divide  by  zero.  In  such  special  cases  display  a  Toast message indicating the error.

The  selected  operation  is  executed  when  the  corresponding  operation’s  button  is clicked.

Your  code  should  check  for  special  cases  such  as  when  there  are  no  numbers entered  or  divide  by  zero.  In  such  special  cases  display  an  alert  dialog  indicating  to the user that an error has occurred.

Use auto layout to configure the layout for both portrait and landscape mode.

## Part 2 

The interface should be created to match the user interface (UI) presented in Figure 2. 

To build the UI, please follow the following tasks:1.Create a new project called “InClass02b”

This  is  a  simple  calculator  for  basic  operations  (  +,-,x,  and  /)  for  two  inputs.  Each button  will  perform  the  logic  of  the  corresponding  operation  and  display  the  result  in the Result textView. 
Note that:a.Add operation: Result = Number1 + Number 2b.Subtract operation: Result = Number1 - Number 2

The app uses the segmented control UI component to display the different operation options.

Your  code  should  check  for  special  cases  such  as  when  there  are  no  numbers entered,  invalid  numbers  and  divide  by  zero.  In  such  special  cases  display  a  Toast message indicating the error.

ClearAll: clear all the input fields and resets the Result to 0.00

The selected operation is executed when the “Perform Operation” button is clicked.

Your  code  should  check  for  special  cases  such  as  when  there  are  no  numbers entered  or  divide  by  zero.  In  such  special  cases  display  an  alert  dialog  indicating  to the user that an error has occurred.

Use auto layout to configure the layout for both portrait and landscape mode.
